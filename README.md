# Freecell_Solitaire_Solver
A Freecell Solitaire Solver developed in python, using the most common algorithms(BFS, DFS, A*, Best-First)

Usage: python Solver.py ***\<Algorithm\>  \<inputFileName\>  \<outputFilename\>***

Algorithm can take these values: BFS, DFS, BEST, ASTAR

Each line in the input file, represents a stack in the board. The last card in each line corresponds to the initial top card of the stack.
